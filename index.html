    <div class="about">
      I enjoy reading youtube comments at least as much as I enjoy watching the videos. If I want to watch a video, but I'm too early and there aren't enough comments, I'll come back later. Here are some of my favorite comments from 2018-now.

    <div class="game">
      <img src="img/banana.gif" alt="banana snake" />
      <h3> word snake </h3>
      <a href="https://alinaf.github.io/bananasnake/">play</a>
      <a href="https://github.com/alinaf/bananasnake">code</a> <br><br>
      I made this because I wanted to make a word game, but all I could find were snake tutorials. Spell out "banana", and continue tacking on alternating "n"s and "a"s. The game ends when you repeat a letter or the snake eats itself.<br><br>

      This was the first game I ever made!
